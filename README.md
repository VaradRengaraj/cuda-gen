This project is a small offshoot from Gen_PES_Pred(https://github.com/VaradRengaraj/Gen_PES_Pred). In Gen_PES_Pred, as part of the dataset generation process, a large file containing the coordinate frames of the atoms is parsed and for each frame, a coulomb matrix[[1]](#1) is generated. This coulomb matrix is then sparsified and the resultant sparse coulomb matrix is divided into several dense smaller submatrices[[2]](#2). The eigenvalues for the submatrices are calculated and each of these eigenvalues vectors are stored in an HDF5 file. A single-threaded, serially running code executing this data generation process is time-consuming and hence a multithreaded Cuda-based approach is explored. 

### Kernels
coulomb      -- generates coulomb matrix<br/>
submatrix    -- sparse coulomb matrix is divided to smaller submatrices<br/>
jacobi-eigen -- calculates eigen values for a symmetric matrix
